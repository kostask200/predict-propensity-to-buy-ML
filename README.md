# Important Note
This repository contains the code implementation and dataset for predicting customer propensity to buy a product using machine learning. However, detailed results, analysis, and additional information are not provided here as they are part of a completed undergraduate dissertation conducted under the auspices of International Hellenic University (former Technological Educational Institute of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace). The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benpowis/customer-propensity-to-purchase-data).
